## about me

i'm a travesty software engineer from brazil who fell in love with functional programming and never looked back. i spend my days crafting elegant abstractions, maintaining open source projects, and co-hosting [elixir em foco](https://elixiremfoco.com), brazil's first elixir podcast.

my code philosophy is simple: if it can be pure, make it pure. if it can be composable, make it composable. if it can help someone, make it open source.

## what i'm into

**music that moves me**

from the industrial power of rammstein to the hypnotic rhythms of mamba negra's dark psytrance, and the raw energy of brazilian funk (rj/sp style). music is how i process the world.

**deconstructing society**

fascinated by how we construct and reconstruct concepts like religion and gender. i love diving deep into social theory and understanding the systems that shape us (and ruin it up).

**building communities**

technology is better when we build it together. whether through podcasts, open source, or helping artisanal fishing communities go digital, i believe in tech that connects people.

**the elixir ecosystem**

from maintaining supabase libraries to creating developer tools, i'm deeply invested in making elixir more accessible and powerful for everyone.

**math (but make it approachable)**

i find beauty in mathematical concepts even though i'm still learning. there's poetry in patterns, even when the proofs escape me.

## find me elsewhere

i mean... i'm not really a fan of social networks anymore, i think we're going into the wrong direction as society considering the current economical system, but, you can find me here:
